"# Working-with-files" 

This may not be a project file but it was my best assignemnt I had completed

//Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The assignment was made to change the temperature from fahrenheit to celsius.
Reading from the given .txt file and converting the location temperatures from fahrenheit to celsius and putting the results into another file.

//What did you do particularly well?
I felt like I did well in managing to open the file and having the contents within be read out, and then placed into another file.

//Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
The biggest problem I have is being a perfectionist. I feel as though I go through many rewrites after I write even a small bit of code.
I worry that what I created may fall apart later, or sometimes the values simply don't want to work, even after correctly formatting them.

/*
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you 
adding to your support network?
*/
Trying to get the .txt file open, close and create a brand new .txt file that correctly formats the locations and calculations.

//What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I'm still not quite used to using user-defined functions but I continue to try. A skill I feel I could take from this is now I can have my code read out .txt files and create new ones within the depository.


//How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Spacing is a key factor in my code, I space everything out as clearly as possible so anyone reading my code wont get distracted from how tightly crunched it could be.
